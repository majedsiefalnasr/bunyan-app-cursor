# Analysis Retry Engine — Bunyan

## Purpose

Intelligent retry and remediation for failed analysis, validation, and guardian checks.

## Retry Strategy

### Attempt 1: Direct Fix

- Parse error output
- Identify failing rule/check
- Apply targeted fix

### Attempt 2: Contextual Fix

- Read surrounding code context
- Understand why the fix failed
- Apply broader fix

### Attempt 3: Alternative Approach

- Consider alternative implementation
- Consult relevant skill for correct pattern
- Rewrite the problematic section

### Attempt 4: Escalate

- If 3 attempts fail → STOP
- Report failure with full context
- Request human intervention
