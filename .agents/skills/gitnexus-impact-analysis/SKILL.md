# GitNexus Impact Analysis — Bunyan

## When to Use

When the user asks:

- "Is it safe to change X?"
- "What depends on this?"
- "What will break if I modify X?"

## Workflow

1. **Identify target**: What symbol/file is being changed?
2. **Query dependents**: Find all code that depends on the target
3. **Assess blast radius**: Categorize impact (direct, transitive)
4. **Risk score**: Low / Medium / High / Critical
5. **Report**: Present impact with affected files and suggestions

## Risk Categories

| Impact          | Risk     | Action         |
| --------------- | -------- | -------------- |
| 0-2 dependents  | Low      | Proceed        |
| 3-5 dependents  | Medium   | Review each    |
| 6-10 dependents | High     | Plan carefully |
| 10+ dependents  | Critical | ADR required   |
