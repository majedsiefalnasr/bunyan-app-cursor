- Project role enum (Owner, Manager, Engineer, Worker, Viewer)
- Team service (add, remove, change role, invite)
- Invitation model with token-based accept flow
- Team member activity tracking

### Frontend

- Team management panel (within project detail)
- Team member invitation form
- Team member role selector
- Team member list with role badges
