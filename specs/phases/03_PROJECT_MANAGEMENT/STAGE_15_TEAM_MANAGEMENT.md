## Objective

Implement team management for projects. Assign users to projects with specific project roles, manage invitations, and track team member activity.

## Scope

### Backend

- Project member model (user + project + project role)
- Project role enum (Owner, Manager, Engineer, Worker, Viewer)
- Team service (add, remove, change role, invite)
- Invitation model with token-based accept flow
- Team member activity tracking

### Frontend

- Team management panel (within project detail)
- Team member invitation form
- Team member role selector
- Team member list with role badges
