# STAGE_06 — API Foundation

> **Phase:** 01_PLATFORM_FOUNDATION
> **Status:** PRODUCTION READY
> **Scope:** API routing, versioning, middleware stack, rate limiting
> **Risk Level:** MEDIUM

## Stage Status

Status: PRODUCTION READY
Step: stage_production_ready
Risk Level: LOW
Closure Date: 2026-04-12

Scope Closed:

- Public `GET /api/v1/health` with platform JSON envelope
- Published CORS configuration for `api/*` and Sanctum SPA flows
- Baseline OpenAPI 3.0.3 under `backend/docs/openapi/openapi.yaml`
- Feature tests for health and correlation ID propagation
- SpecKit runtime artifacts under `specs/runtime/006-api-foundation/`

Deferred Scope:

- Hosted Swagger UI (optional)
- Full OpenAPI coverage for all domain routes (incremental)

Architecture Governance Compliance:

- ADR alignment verified (versioned API, thin controller, existing error contract)
- RBAC enforcement confirmed on existing route groups; new route is intentionally public
- Service layer architecture maintained for this slice
- Error contract compliance verified (`ApiResponse` + STAGE_05 renderer)

Notes:
Stage closed via orchestrator autopilot (`auto_advance=true`). Modifications require a new stage or amendment protocol.

## Objective

Establish the API foundation including routing conventions, middleware stack, rate limiting, API versioning, and resource formatting patterns.

## Scope

### Backend

- API route organization (versioned: /api/v1/\*)
- Base API controller with response helpers
- API Resource base class
- Rate limiting configuration
- CORS configuration
- Request throttling middleware
- API documentation setup (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Health check endpoint

### Middleware Stack

```
Request
→ CORS
→ Rate Limit
→ Auth (Sanctum)
→ RBAC
→ Correlation ID
→ Request Logging
→ Controller
→ Response Logging
→ Response
```

## Dependencies

- **Upstream:** STAGE_04_RBAC_SYSTEM, STAGE_05_ERROR_HANDLING
- **Downstream:** All API endpoints
