2. `.agents/skills/governance-preamble/SKILL.md` — Shared governance
3. `.agents/skills/laravel-patterns/SKILL.md` — Laravel conventions

5. `.agents/skills/error-handling-patterns/SKILL.md` — Error handling

## Architecture Layers

```
Routes → Middleware (auth, RBAC) → Controllers → Services → Repositories → Models
```

- **Controllers**: Thin. Validate (Form Request), call service, return Resource.
- **Services**: Business logic. No HTTP concerns, no direct Eloquent queries.
- **Repositories**: Database access. Eloquent queries only here.
- **Models**: Relationships, scopes, accessors. No business logic.

## Key Patterns

### Form Requests

- All validation in Form Request classes
- Authorization via `authorize()` method
- Custom messages for Arabic error messages

### API Resources

- All API responses via Resource/Collection classes
- Standard envelope: `{ success, data, message, errors }`
- Conditional includes via `whenLoaded()`

### Policies

- Model-level authorization via Policy classes
- Register in `AuthServiceProvider`
- Check via `$this->authorize()` or `Gate::allows()`

### Events & Listeners

- Decouple side effects (notifications, logging, cache invalidation)
- Use event classes in `app/Events/`
- Register listeners in `EventServiceProvider`

### Jobs & Queues

- Heavy processing goes to background jobs
- Use `ShouldQueue` interface
- Implement `failed()` method for error handling

### Sanctum Authentication

- Token-based API authentication
- Abilities/scopes on tokens for granular permissions
- Token expiration and refresh patterns

## Migration Discipline

- Forward-only migrations
- Always include `down()` method
- Never modify existing migration files
- Use `php artisan make:migration` naming conventions

## Testing

- PHPUnit for unit tests (services, repositories)
- Laravel HTTP tests for feature tests (endpoints)
- Use `RefreshDatabase` trait
- Factory-based test data
